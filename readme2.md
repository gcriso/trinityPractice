# Week 4 part II 

## Trinity

This directory contains the trinity fasta file that I created from the clean reads of my SRR files.

## Transdecoder

this directory contains 3 orfs or open read frames that was developed using Transdecoder. Within these fasta files, we are able to know the transcript name, the type of annotation it is: internall, complete, 3' and 5' partial, and its length. The .pep contains amino acid while .cds contains proteins.

## Blast output 

A tabulated form of blast that contains the ORF name, hit name from Swissprot database, percent identity, gap presence, e-value, starting/ending position of query, and bit score.
